# Lottery

 A lottery game in java
 
 Firstly the program generates the winning numbers between 1 and 99 and prints out their sum

 As a bonus game the program generates four prize sums which the user can win in addition to the lottery winning.
 
 If the same sum appears more than once, the user wins that sum
 
 Then the user is asked to enter 5 numbers, which are not supposed to be the same, and try to guess the winning sum of all 10 numbers
 
 Then the program analyzes how much the user won
 
 First way
 
 The program checks how many numbers out of the winning 10 the user guessed correctly.
 
 One is €1000, two is €6000, three is €25,000, four is €100,000 and five is €800,000.
 
 The order is not important.
 
 Second way
 
 The program checks if the user guessed any sequences
 
 A sequence must include two or more numbers and must not have gaps
 A two-number sequence wins €70,000
 A three-number sequence is €400,000
 A four-number sequence is €1,000,000
 A five-number sequence is €5,000,000
 
 Third way
 If the user correctly guessed the sum of all winning numbers, they win €300,000
